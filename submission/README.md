## Prerequisites
- Install the z3 package using ```pip3 install z3-solver```. (If this does not work, try ```python3 -m pip install z3-solver```)
- One may require ```numpy```, in case ```q3.py``` is run without command line arguments.


## Instructions to run the code

- For these questions, you are welcome to create custom input files; make sure to adhere to the format visible in the corresponding sample inputs, though.

- For Question 1, run ```python3 q1.py```.

- For Question 2, run ```python3 q2.py <path-to-input-file>``` . Some sample input files have been included in the folder ```q2_input/``` . 

- For Question 3, run ```python3 q3.py <path-to-input-file>``` . Some sample input files have been included in the folder ```q3_input/``` .

- If you run ```q3.py``` without any arguments, it will generate a random binary matrix of size ```default_size```, and will then carry out scheduling on that matrix!
